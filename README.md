The table tennis based "Pong game"
Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. 
The player moves an in-game paddle vertically across the left or right side of the screen to control it. They can battle against another player on the opposite side who controls a second paddle. The paddles are used to strike the ball back and forth. The objective is for each player to score eleven points before the other; points are awarded when one player fails to return the ball to the other.
